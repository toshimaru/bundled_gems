# BundledGems

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bundled_gems.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bundled_gems)

Install a gem specified in `Gemfile.lock` without running `bundle install`.

## Motivation

After the emergence of Docker, libraries (such as rubygems) are installed inside Docker or Docker Volume, but we sometimes want to install specific version of libraries in Host machine.

Here comes the bundled_gems command (`bgem`). `bgem` reads your `Gemfile.lock` and install the specific version of the gem.

## Installation

```console
$ gem install bundled_gems
```

Then, `bgem` command is available.

## Usage

```console
$ bgem                    
Commands:
  bgem help [COMMAND]         # Describe available commands or one specific command
  bgem install [BUNDLED_GEM]  # install [BUNDLED_GEM] specified in `Gemfile.lock`
  bgem list                   # bundle list without `bundle install`
  bgem version                # bundled_gems version
```

### List gems

```console
$ bgem list
Gems included in `Gemfile.lock`:
  * actionpack, 5.2.3
  * actionview, 5.2.3
  * activesupport, 5.2.3
  ...(snip)...
```

### Install gem

```console
$ bgem install gem_name
```

## Example

```console
$ gem install bundled_gems  # Install bundled_gems and `bgem` command is available
$ bgem install rubocop      # install rubocop specified in `Gemfile.lock`
$ rubocop                   # Run rubocop
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
